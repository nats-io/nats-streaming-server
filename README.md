# Important Changes

## Version `0.4.0`

The Store interface was updated. There are 2 news APIs:

* `Recover()`: The recovery of persistent state was previously done in the constructor of the store implementation.<br>
It is now separate and specified with this API. The server will first instantiate the store, in
which some initialization or checks can be made.<br>
If no error is reported, the server will then proceed with calling `Recover()`, which will returned the recovered state.<br>
* `GetExclusiveLock()`: In Fault Tolerance mode, when a server is elected leader, it will attempt to get an exclusive
lock to the shared storage before proceeding.<br>

Check the [Store interface](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server/blob/master/stores/store.go) for more information.

# Concepts

## Relation to NATS

NATS Streaming Server by default embeds a [NATS](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd) server. That is, the Streaming server is not a server per-se, but instead, a client to a NATS Server.<br>
It means that Streaming clients are not directly connected to the streaming server, but instead communicate with the streaming server *through* NATS Server.

This detail is important when it comes to Streaming clients connections to the Streaming server. Indeed, since there is no direct
connection, the server knows if a client is connected based on heartbeats.

***It is therefore strongly recommended for clients to close their connection when the application exit, otherwise the server
will consider these clients connected (sending data, etc...) until it detects missing hearbeats.***

The streaming server creates internal subscriptions on specific subjects to communicate withs its clients and/or other servers.

Note that NATS clients and NATS Streaming clients cannot exchange data between each other. That is, if a streaming client
publishes on `foo`, a NATS client subscribing on that same subject will not receive the messages. Streaming messages are NATS
messages made of a protobuf. The streaming server is expected to send ACKs back to producers and receive ACKs from consumers.
If messages were freely exchanged with the NATS clients, this would cause problems.

## Clients Connections

As described, clients are not directly connected to the streaming server. Instead, they send connection requests. The request
includes a `client ID` which is used by the server to uniquely identify, and restrict, a given client. That is, no two
connections with the same client ID will be able to run concurrently.

This client ID links a given connection to its published messages, subscriptions, especially durable subscriptions. Indeed, durable
subscriptions are stored as a combination of the client ID and durable name. More on durable subscriptions later.

It is also used to resolve the issue of not having direct client connections to the server. For instance, say that a client crashes
without closing the connection. It later restarts with the same client ID. The server will detect that this client ID is already
in-use. It will try to contact that known client to its original private inbox. If the server does not receive a response - which
would be the case if the client crashed - it will replace the old client with this new one.<br>
Otherwise, the server would reject the connection request since the client ID is already in-use.

## Channels

Channels are at the heart of the NATS Streaming Server. Channels are subjects clients send data to and consume from.

***Note: NATS Streaming server does not support wildcard for channels, that is, one cannot subscribe on `foo.*`, or `>`, etc...***

The number of channels can be limited (and is by default) through configuration. Messages produced to a channel are stored
in a message log inside this channel.

### Message Log

You can view a message log as a ring buffer. Messages are appended to the end of the log. If a limit is set gobally for all channels, or specifically for this channel, when the limit is reached, older messages are removed to make room for the new ones.

But except for the administrative size/age limit set for a message log, messages are not removed due to consumers consuming them.
In fact, messages are stored regardless of the presence of subscriptions on that channel.

### Subscriptions

A client creates a subscription on a given channel. Remember, there is no support for wildcards, so a subscription is really tied to
one and only one channel. The server will maintain the subscription state on behalf of the client until the later closes the subscription (or its connection).

If there are messages in the log for this channel, messages will be sent to the consumer when the subscription is created. The server will
send up to the maximum number of inflight messages as given by the client when creating the subscription.

When receiving ACKs from the consumer, the server will then deliver more messages, if more are available.

A subscription can be created to start at any point in the message log, either by message sequence, or by time.

There are several type of subscriptions:

#### Regular

The state of these subscriptions is removed when they are unsubscribed or closed (which is equivalent for this type of subscription) or
the client connection is closed (explicitly by the client, or closed by the server due to timeout). They do, however, survive a *server*
failure (if running with a persistent store).

#### Durable

If an application wishes to resume message consumption from where it previously stopped, it needs to create a durable subscription.
It does so by providing a durable name, which is combined with the client ID provided when the client created its connection. The server then
maintain the state for this subscription even after the client connection is closed.

***Note: The starting position given by the client when restarting a durable subscription is ignored.***

When the application wants to stop receving messages on a durable subscription, it should close - but *not unsubscribe*- this subscription.
If a given client library does not have the option to close a subscription, the application should close the connection instead.

When the application wants to delete the subscription, it must unsubscribe it. Once unsubscribed, the state is removed and it is then
possible to re-use the durable name, but it will be considered a brand new durable subscription, with the start position being the one
given by the client when creating the durable subscription.

#### Queue Group

When consumers want to consume from the same channel but each receive a different message - as opposed to all receiving the same messages -,
they need to create a queue subscription. When a queue group name is specified, the server will send each messages from the log to a single
consumer in the group. The distribution of these messages is not specified, therefore applications should not rely on an expected delivery
scheme.

After the first queue member is created, any other member joining the group will receive messages based on where the server is in the message log for that particular group. That means that starting position given by joining members is ignored by the server.

When the last member of the group leaves (subscription unsubscribed/closed/or connection closed), the group is removed from the server.
The next application creating a subscription with the same name will create a new group, starting at the start position given in the subscription request.

Queue subscriptions can also be durables. In this case, the client provides also a durable name. The behavior is, as you would expect,
a combination of queue and durable subscriptions. The main difference is that when the last member leaves the group, the state of
the group will be maintained by the server. Later, when a member rejoins the group, the delivery will resume.

***Note: For a durable queue subscription, the last member to * unsubscribe * (not simply close) causes the group to  be removed from the server.***

#### Redelivery

When the server sends a message to a consumer, it expects to receive an ACK from this consumer. The consumer is the one specifying
how long the server should wait before resending all unacknowledged messages to the consumer.

When the server restarts and recovers unacknowledged messages for a subscription, it will first attempt to redelivery those
messages before sending new messages. However, if during the initial redelivery some messages don't make it to the client,
the server cannot know that and will enable delivery of new messages.

***So it is possible for an application to receive redelivered messages mixed with new messages. This is typically what happens
outside of the server restart scenario.***

For queue subscriptions, if a member has unacknowledged messages, when this member `AckWait` (which is the duration given to the
server before the server should attempt to redeliver unacknowledged messages) time elapses, the messages are redelivered to any
other member in the group (including itself).

If a queue member leaves the group, its unacknowledged messages are redistributed to other queue members.

## Store Interface

Every store implementation follows the [Store interface](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server/blob/master/stores/store.go).

On startup, the server creates a unique instance of the `Store`. The constructor of a store implementation can do some
initialization and configuration check, but *must not* access, or attempt to recover, the storage at this point. This is important
because when the server runs on Fault Tolerance mode, the storage must be shared across many servers but only one server can be
using it.

After instantiating the store, the server will then call `Recover()` in order to recover the persisted state. For implementations
that do not support persitence, such as the provided `MemoryStore`, this call will simply return `nil` (without error) to
indicate that no state was recovered.

The `Store` is used to add/delete clients, create/lookup channels, etc...

Creating/looking up a channel will return a `ChannelStore`, which points to two other interfaces, the `SubStore` and `MsgStore`. These stores, for a given channel, handle subscriptions and messages respectively.

If you wish to contribute to a new store type, your implementation must include all these interfaces. For stores that allow recovery (such as file store as opposed to memory store), there are additional structures that have been defined and should be returned by `Recover()`.

The memory and the provided file store implementations both use a generic store implementation to avoid code duplication.
When writing your own store implementation, you can do the same for APIs that don't need to do more than what the generic implementation provides.
You can check [MemStore](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server/blob/master/stores/memstore.go) and [FileStore](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server/blob/master/stores/filestore.go) implementations for more details.

## Clustering

NATS Streaming Server does not support clustering at this time. The confusion is that it can run with a cluster of NATS Servers,
but as previously explained, the NATS Servers are the backbone of the streaming systems. So it is possible to run a single
streaming server attached to a cluster of NATS Servers and streaming clients attached to any of the NATS Server in the NATS cluster.

Streaming clustering with full replication of data across a set of streaming servers is planned for later this year.

## Fault Tolerance

To minimize the single point of failure, NATS Streaming server can be run in Fault Tolerance mode. It works by having a group
of servers with one acting as the active server (accessing the store) and handling all communication with clients, and all others
acting as standby servers.

To start a server in Fault Tolerance (FT) mode, you specify an FT group name, and each server in the group need to have a dedicated log file. This log is used for the leader election (we use RAFT for that). This file does not need to be in the shared storage. In fact,
it is probably better to not too if you want to configure all your servers with the same config/command line parameters, ensure that
the FT logfile is local.

### Active Server

There is a single Active server in the group. This server is elected and ensures that it can get an exclusive lock for the storage.
For the `FileStore` implementation, it means trying to get an advisory lock for a file located in the shared datastore. If the
elected server fails to grab this lock, it will go back to standby.

***Only the active server accesses the store and service all clients.***

### Standby servers

There can be as many as you want standby servers on the same group. These servers do not access the store and do not receive any data from the streaming clients. They are just running waiting for the detectiong of the active server failure.

### Shared State

Actual file replication to multiple disks is not handled by the Streaming server. This - if required - needs to be handled by the user. For the FileStore implementation that we currently provide, the data store needs to be mounted by all servers in the FT group (e.g. an NFS Mount (Gluster in Google Cloud or EFS in Amazon).

### Failover

When the active server fails, one of the standby will be elected leader. In that role, it is going to attempt to get an exclusive lock
to the store. If it succeeds, it becomes active and goes through the process of recovering the store and service clients. It is as if a server in standalone mode was automatically restarted. If it fails to get the store lock, it will go back to standby mode. Another election will shortly occur and the process repeats until a standby is fully promoted to active server.

By default, the quorum for the FT group is set to 1, but you can configure this number. The quorum is the number of servers required
for an election to take place. It can be useful to minimize risk of network partitions by forcing a certain number of servers reachable
in the group in order to have an election.

# Getting Started

The best way to get the NATS Streaming Server is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux (x86-64/ARM), Windows. Instructions for using these binaries are on the GitHub releases page.

Of course you can build the latest version of the server from the master branch. The master branch will always build and pass tests, but may not work correctly in your environment. You will first need Go installed on your machine (version 1.5+ is required) to build the NATS server.

See also the NATS Streaming Quickstart [tutorial](https://nats.io/documentation/streaming/nats-streaming-quickstart/).

## Building

Building the NATS Streaming Server from source requires at least version 1.6 of Go, but we encourage the use of the latest stable release. Information on installation, including pre-built binaries, is available at http://golang.org/doc/install. Stable branches of operating system packagers provided by your OS vendor may not be sufficient.

Run `go version` to see the version of Go which you have installed.

Run `go build` inside the directory to build.

Run `go test ./...` to run the unit regression tests.

A successful build produces no messages and creates an executable called `nats-streaming-server` in the current directory. You can invoke that binary, with no options and no configuration file, to start a server with acceptable standalone defaults (no authentication, memory store).

Run go help for more guidance, and visit http://golang.org/ for tutorials, presentations, references and more.

## Running

The NATS Streaming Server embeds a NATS Server. Starting the server with no argument will give you a server with default settings and a memory based store.

The server will be started and listening for client connections on port 4222 (the default) from all available interfaces. The logs will be displayed to stderr as shown above.

Note that you do not need to start the embedded NATS Server. It is started automatically when you run the NATS Streaming Server. See below for details on how you secure the embedded NATS Server.

## Configuration file

You can use a configuration file to configure the options specific to the NATS Streaming server.

Use the `-sc` or `-stan_config` command line parameter to specify the file to use.

Note the order in which options are applied during the start of a NATS Streaming server:

1. Start with some reasonable default options.
2. If a configuration file is specified, override those options
  with all options defined in the file. This include options that are defined
  but have no value specified. In this case, the zero value for the type of the
  option will be used.
3. Any command line parameter override all of the previous set options.

In general the configuration parameters are the same as the command line arguments.
But see an example configuration file below for more details:

```
# Define the cluster name.
# Can be id, cid or cluster_id
id: "my_cluster_name"

# Store type
# Can be st, store, store_type or StoreType
# Possible values are file or memory (case insensitive)
store: "file"

# When using a file store, need to provide the root directory.
# Can be dir or datastore
dir: "/path/to/storage"

# Debug flag.
# Can be sd or stand_debug
sd: false

# Trace flag.
# Can be sv or stan_trace
sv: false

# If specified, connects to an external NATS server, otherwise
# starts and embedded server.
# Can be ns, nats_server or nats_server_url
ns: "nats://localhost:4222"

# This flag creates a TLS connection to the server but without
# the need to use a TLS configuration (no NATS server certificate verification).
secure: false

# Interval at which the server sends an heartbeat to a client,
# expressed as a duration.
# Can be hbi, hb_interval, server_to_client_hb_interval
hb_interval: "10s"

# How long the server waits for a heartbeat response from the client
# before considering it a failed hearbeat. Expressed as a duration.
# Can be hbt, hb_timeout, server_to_client_hb_timeout
hb_timeout: "10s"

# Count of failed hearbeats before server closes the client connection.
# The actual total wait is: (fail count + 1) * (hb interval + hb timeout).
# Can be hbf, hb_fail_count, server_to_client_hb_fail_count
hb_fail_count: 2

# Normally, when a client creates a subscription, the server creates
# an internal subscription to receive its ACKs.
# If lots of subscriptions are created, the number of internal
# subscriptions in the server could be very high. To curb this growth,
# use this parameter to configure a pool of internal ACKs subscriptions.
# Can be ack_subs_pool_size, ack_subscriptions_pool_size
ack_subs_pool_size: 10

# In Fault Tolerance mode, you can start a group of streaming servers
# with only one server being active while other are running in standby
# mode. The FT group is named.
# Can be ft_group, ft_group_name
ft_group: "ft"

# This is the number of servers needed to be able to elect a leader
# that will act as the active server. For example, if set to 2, a
# single server will stay in standby mode until another server in
# that group is reachable. This can be useful to reduce risks of

## Store Limits

The `store_limits` section in the configuration file (or the command line parameters
`-mc`, `-mm`, etc..) allow you to configure the global limits.

These limits somewhat offer some upper bound on the size of the storage. By multiplying
the limits per channel with the maximum number of channels, you will get a total limit.

It is also possible to define specific limits per channel. Here is how:

```
...
store_limits: {
    # Override some global limits
    max_channels: 10
    max_msgs: 10000
    max_bytes: 10485760
    max_age: "1h"

    # Per channel configuration.
    # Can be channels, channels_limits, per_channel, per_channel_limits or ChannelsLimits
    channels: {
        # Configuration for channel "foo"
        "foo": {
            # Possible options are the same than in the store_limits section
            # except for max_channels.
            max_msgs: 300
            max_subs: 50
        }
        "bar": {
            max_msgs:50
            max_bytes:1000
        }
    }
}
...
```

Note the following restrictions:
- The total of channels configured must be less than the store's maximum number of channels.
- No limit can be negative.
- No limit can be greater than its corresponding global limit.

### Limits inheritance

Global limits that are not specified (configuration file or command line parameters)
are inherited from default limits selected by the server.

Per-channel limits that are not explicitly configured inherit from the corresponding
global limit (which can itself be inherited from default limit).

On startup the server displays the store limits. Notice the `*` at the right of a
limit to indicate that the limit was inherited (either from global or default limits).
This is what would be displayed with the above store limits configuration:

## Securing

### Authorization

If you use basic authorization, that is a single user defined through the configuration file or command line parameters, nothing else is required. The embedded NATS Server is started with those credentials and the NATS Streaming Server uses them.

However, if you define multiple users, then you **must** specify the username and password (or token) corresponding to the NATS Streaming Server's user.

For instance, suppose that your configuration file `server.cfg` has the following content:

```
listen: 127.0.0.1:4233
http: 127.0.0.1:8233

authorization {
    users = [
      {user: alice, password: foo}
      {user: bob,   password: bar}
    ]
}
```
and you start the NATS Streaming Server this way:
```sh
nats-streaming-server -config server.cfg
```
then the server would fail to start. You **must** specify the user used by the streaming server. For instance:
```sh
nats-streaming-server -config server.cfg -user alice -pass foo
```

### TLS

While there are several TLS related parameters to the streaming server, securing the NATS Streaming server's connection is straightforward when you bear in mind that the relationship between the NATS Streaming server and the embedded NATS server is a client server relationship.  To state simply, the streaming server is a client of it's embedded NATS server.

That means two sets of TLS configuration parameters must be used:  TLS server parameters for the embedded NATS server, and TLS client parameters for the streaming server itself.

The streaming server specifies it's TLS client certificates with the following three parameters:
```    
    -tls_client_key              Client key for the streaming server

    -tls_client_cert             Client certificate for the streaming server

    -tls_client_cacert           Client certificate CA for the streaming server
```

These could be the same certificates used with your NATS streaming clients.

The embedded NATS server specifies TLS server certificates with these:

```
        --tlscert <file>             Server certificate file

        --tlskey <file>              Private key for server certificate

        --tlscacert <file>           Client certificate CA for verification
```

The server parameters are used the same way you would secure a typical NATS server. See [here](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd#securing-nats).

Proper usage of the NATS Streaming Server requires the use of both client and server parameters.

e.g.:

```sh
nats-streaming-server -tls_client_cert client-cert.pem -tls_client_key client-key.pem -tls_client_cacert ca.pem -tlscert server-cert.pem -tlskey server-key.pem -tlscacert ca.pem
```

Further TLS related functionality can be found in [usage](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd#securing-nats), and should specifying cipher suites be required, a configuration file for the embedded NATS server can be passed through the `-config` command line parameter.

## Persistence

By default, the NATS Streaming Server stores its state in memory, which means that if the streaming server is stopped, all state is lost. Still, this level of persistence allows applications to stop and later resume the stream of messages, and protect against applications disconnect (network or applications crash).

### File Store

For a higher level of message delivery, the server should be configured with a file store. NATS Streaming Server comes with a basic file store implementation. Various file store implementations may be added in the future.

To start the server with a file store, you need to provide two parameters:

```sh
nats-streaming-server -store file -dir datastore
```
The parameter `-store` indicates what type of store to use, in this case `file`. The other (`-dir`) indicates in which directory the state should be stored.

The first time the server is started, it will create two files in this directory, one containing some server related information (`server.dat`) another to record clients information (`clients.dat`).

When a streaming client connects, it uses a client identification, which the server registers in this file. When the client disconnects, the client is cleared from this file.

When the client publishes or subscribe to a new subject (also called channel), the server creates a sub-directory whose name is the subject. For instance, if the client subscribes to `foo`, and assuming that you started the server with `-dir datastore`, then you will find a directory called `datastore/foo`. In this directory you will find several files: one to record subscriptions information (`subs.dat`), and a series of files that logs the messages `msgs.1.dat`, etc...

The number of sub-directories, which again correspond to channels, can be limited by the configuration parameter `-max_channels`. When the limit is reached, any new subscription or message published on a new channel will produce an error.

On a given channel, the number of subscriptions can also be limited with the configuration parameter `-max_subs`. A client that tries to create a subscription on a given channel (subject) for which the limit is reached will receive an error.

Finally, the number of stored messages for a given channel can also be limited with the parameter `-max_msgs` and/or `-max_bytes`. However, for messages, the client does not get an error when the limit is reached. The oldest messages are discarded to make room for the new messages.

#### File Store Options

As described in the [Configuring](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server#configuring) section, there are several options that you can use to configure a file store.

Regardless of channel limits, you can configure message logs to be split in individual files (called file slices). You can configure
those slices by number of messages it can contain (`--file_slice_max_msgs`), the size of the file - including the corresponding index file
(`--file_slice_max_bytes`), or the period of time that a file slice should cover - starting at the time the first message is stored in
that slice (`--file_slice_max_age`). The default file store options are defined such that only the slice size is configured to 64MB.

Note: If you don't configure any slice limit but you do configure channel limits, then the server will automatically
set some limits for file slices.

When messages accumulate in a channel, and limits are reached, older messages are removed. When the first file slice
becomes empty, the server removes this file slice (and corresponding index file).

However, if you specify a script (`--file_slice_archive_script`), then the server will rename the slice files (data and index)
with a `.bak` extension and invoke the script with the channel name, data and index file names.<br>
The files are left in the channel's directory and therefore it is the script responsibility to delete those files when done.
At any rate, those files will not be recovered on a server restart, but having lots of unused files in the directory may slow
down the server restart.

For instance, suppose the server is about to delete file slice `datastore/foo/msgs.1.dat` (and `datastore/foo/msgs.1.idx`),
and you have configured the script `/home/nats-streaming/archive_script.sh`. The server will invoke:

``` bash
/home/nats-streaming/archive_script.sh foo datastore/foo/msgs.1.dat.bak datastore/foo/msgs.2.idx.bak
```
Notice how the files have been renamed with the `.bak` extension so that they are not going to be recovered if
the script leave those files in place.

As previously described, each channel corresponds to a sub-directory that contains several files. It means that the need
for file descriptors increase with the number of channels. In order to scale to ten or hundred thousands of channels,
the option `fds_limit` (or command line parameter `--file_fds_limit`) may be considered to limit the total use of file descriptors.

Note that this is a soft limit. It is possible for the store to use more file descriptors than the given limit if the
number of concurrent read/writes to different channels is more than the said limit. It is also understood that this
may affect performance since files may need to be closed/re-opened as needed.
